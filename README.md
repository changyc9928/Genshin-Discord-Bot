## Emergency Food Bot

The un-official emergency food bot for Discord is finally here! Equipped with the latest cool technologies, Painmon is here to schedule and manage your pain hours in Jensin Impact and many more, including daily grind information on domains and materials, as well as your very own wish viewer!

## Running the bot locally

To run the bot locally, simply install the latest requirements using `pip` by:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and then run the bot by:
```
python main.py
```
That is of course, you already have Python >= 3.7 and `pip` installed. **Ensure that you have obtained our token first before using it.** If you do not have the token, simply leave an issue here and we'll get back to ya.
